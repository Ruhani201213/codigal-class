Pizza (Italian: ['pittsa], Neapolitan: ['pittsa]) is a savory dish of Italian origin
consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with
tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms,
onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature,
traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A
person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.
